# --- Version Notes ---
# - It's good practice to pin major/minor versions for reproducibility.
# - CRITICAL: The scikit-learn version used here MUST be compatible with the version
#   used when saving the model pipeline (.joblib file) to avoid loading errors.
#   Ideally, use the exact same version.
# - The openai library version >= 1.0.0 is important due to significant API changes.
# - Feel free to adjust version constraints based on your specific environment
#   or dependency resolver findings.

# --- Optional for Development/Testing ---
# pytest>=7.0.0             # For running tests in the /tests directory
# jupyterlab>=3.5.0         # For running notebooks in the /notebooks directory
